Welcome to pymace's documentation!
===================================
**MACE** (/meÉªs/) is a Mobile Ad Hoc Computing Emulator that was created to support research in the field. Its main goal
was to fill a gap in the **available** tools to emulate existing applications deployed in heterogenous hardware with *mobility* and *wireless* links.
Details about the motivation, implementation and some tests were described in a conference  `paper <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9522185>`_.
